## üöÄ Project Objective
Design a **navigation system** for a robot operating in a structured warehouse environment. The robot must avoid **10 obstacles**, ensuring that no two obstacles are closer than 1 meter to each other. The robot's sensors can detect obstacles within a range of **0.2 meters**, and it must use this data to alter its path.

### Key Features:
- **Robot Specifications**:
  - Wheel Diameter: 10 cm
  - Distance Between Wheels: 30 cm
  - Linear Velocity: 1 m/s
  - Angular Velocity: 3 rad/s
- **Warehouse Setup**:
  - **Obstacles**: 10 obstacles are spread across the floor.
  - **Obstacle Avoidance**: Obstacles can be detected within a 0.2-meter range.

## üß† Algorithm Design
### Decision-Making Process
The core algorithm revolves around **sensor data** to detect obstacles and dynamically adjust the robot's movement:

1. **Obstacle Detection**: The robot uses its proximity sensors to continuously monitor for nearby obstacles.
2. **Path Calculation**: If an obstacle is detected within 0.2 meters, the robot calculates a new path to avoid it, ensuring minimal deviation from the desired trajectory.
3. **Steering**: The angular velocity of 3 rad/s allows the robot to make rapid directional adjustments to navigate around obstacles without significant delays.
